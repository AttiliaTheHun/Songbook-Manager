# Songbook Manager
Songbook Manager is a program for creation and management of a printable songbook with lyrics and chords alike.

The songbook is made in HTML format (which means you should know the basics of HTML and CSS) to ensure easy printability and a web version.

The Manager is a standalone desktop program, but you can choose to pair it with a webserver for online preview of the songbook and also for collaboration with other people.
