*NOTE: The program is currently in an early-access version. The codebase should be stable, but some features are not yet complete and there is much optimization to be done.*

The songbook is made in HTML format (which means you should know the basics of HTML and CSS), so you have complete control over the look of the songs as long as you can apply the correct markup. 

It is expected that you will want to print the songbook on paper at some point, the program supports that. In fact it is the very reason the program was created. Some example PDF files created using this program are [this A4 version](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17819805/Hrabosi.zpevnik.A4.opraveny.pdf) and [this A5 version for printing](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17819811/Hrabosi.zpevnik.A5.duplex.print.opraveny.pdf).

To try out the program or as a sample/test songbook you can import [this file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18520335/data.zip).
